# Lucid Code challenge

Code challenge proposed by Lucid during its hiring process.

It was based on a description sent by the company which can be found on the 
Documentation section of this README file.

Requirements
-----

To run this application, you will need Python 3.7 or later installed.

Assumptions
-----

 * Assumption 1 - Stop Condition
  
   As the Technical Assessment description does not provide a stop condition 
while reading the input, it was assumed that a blank line is the stop 
condition.

Instructions to Run (Command Line)
---------

From the command-line, you can execute the main.py file and then type in the
input lines. Considering you are at the root folder of this project:

    python src/main.py 16:10
    
You can also provide a file with the input so it is easier to run. An example 
of how to do it using the input procided in the test is:

    python src/main.py 16:10 < docs/example-input.txt
